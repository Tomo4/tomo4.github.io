    <h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My name is Thomas, though my pseudonym of choice is Tomo. I'm a Canadian male, and currently seventeen years of age; born October 2nd, 2002. I'm straight, but am very much supportive of LGBTQ+. As of now, I'm suffering through the dumpster fire that is high school while spending my free time working on various mods for Nintendo Switch games and occasionally other things.</br></br></br>
	Along with game modding, my interests include...</br></br>
	- Super Smash Bros.</br>
	- Kirby</br>
	- EarthBound/MOTHER</br>
	- Yume Nikki</br>
	- UNDERTALE</br>
	- Paper Mario (specifically SPM)</br>
	- Obscure web horror content</br>
	- Surreal horror</br>
	- Mathematics</br>
	- Archival of information</br>
	- World history</br>
	- Game OST</br>
	- Probably other things</br></br></br>
	I'm usually an okay person to be around, but I'll admit I can be a little nasty sometimes. I'm not, never have been, and never will be good at interacting with people, especially through means other than a keyboard. So, I usually keep to myself. But with that, I've plenty of time to engage in a lot of self-exploration. I've learned a fair bit, believe it or not!</br></br>
	That's really about all I have to say about me. I hope it gives you a better idea of me as a person.
