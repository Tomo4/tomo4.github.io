    <h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My name is Thomas, though my pseudonym of choice is Tomo. I'm a Canadian male, and currently sixteen years of age; born October 2nd, 2002. I'm straight, but am very much supportive of LGBTQ+. As of now, I'm suffering through the dumpster fire that is high school while spending my free time working on various mods for Nintendo Switch games and occasionally other things.</br></br></br>
	Along with game modding, my interests include...</br></br>
	- Super Smash Bros.</br>
	- Kirby</br>
	- EarthBound/MOTHER</br>
	- Yume Nikki</br>
	- UNDERTALE</br>
	- Paper Mario (specifically SPM)</br>
	- Obscure web horror content</br>
	- Surreal horror</br>
	- Mathematics</br>
	- Archival of information</br>
	- World history</br>
	- Game OST</br>
	- Probably other things</br></br></br>
	I try to keep a positive mindset, but that doesn't always work out. I have very high anxiety, however I am working towards overcoming that. I don't really have any close friends in a real-life environment. But I've learned to be okay with that. For all the darkness residing across the internet, the good is there if you look at little!</br></br>
	That's really about all I have to say about me. I hope it gives you a better idea of me as a person.
