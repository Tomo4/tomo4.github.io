    <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
	<p>Hi there. My pseudonym is Tomo, and I'm a general content creator, specializing at the moment in video game modding. I'm currently focusing on modding Nintendo Switch games for the most part.</br>
	For a more detailed look at who I am, please see the <a href="aboutme">About Me</a> page.</br></br>
	To have a look at and/or download any mods I've created, you'd best refer to the <a href="myworks">My Works</a> page, and as for content that doesn't really fit that description, you should be able to find it at the <a href="misc">Misc.</a> page. You can feel free to use, modify, and/or redistribute my content, with the sole stipulation being that you provide proper credit. I think I am being very reasonable, so please honor that one rule. Failure to do so may result in being named and shamed on this very website for all to see.</br></br>
	Lastly, if you want or need to contact me for any reason, the <a href="contact">Contact</a> page will offer means to do so. If you'd rather just read my ramblings, you can do this on my <a href="https://twitter.com/Tomo1623">Twitter page</a>.</br></br>
	I'd strongly recommend viewing this site in 1080p resolution, on desktop rather than mobile. I don't know or care if it's messed up in other resolutions or platforms.</br></br>
	Take care, and enjoy your visit.</p>
