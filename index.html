    <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
	<p>Hi there. My pseudonym is Tomo, and I'm a general content creator, specializing at the moment in pixel art, miscellaneous image creation, and video game modding. I'm currently focusing on modding Nintendo Switch games for the most part.</br>
	For a more detailed look at who I am, please see the About Me page.</br></br>
	To have a look at and/or download any images or mods I've created, you'd best refer to the My Works page, and as for content that doesn't really fit that description, you should be able to find it at the Misc. page. You can feel free to use, modify, and/or redistribute my content, with the sole stipulation being that you provide proper credit. I think I am being very reasonable, so please honor that one rule. Failure to do so may result in being called-out on this very website for all to see.</br></br>
	Lastly, if you want or need to contact me for any reason, the Contact page will offer means to do so.</br></br>
	Take care, and enjoy your visit.</p>
